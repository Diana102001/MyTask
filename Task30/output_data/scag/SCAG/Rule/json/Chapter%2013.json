The Securities Commissioner may require as a condition of registration that a security issued within the previous five (5) years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow; and that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this State be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this State or elsewhere.",
        "[[POINT]] B. Impoundment of Proceeds (1) When proceeds from the sale of securities are required to be impounded pursuant to Section A of this Rule, the proceeds must be deposited in an interest bearing escrow or trust account with an impoundment agent. The impoundment agent may not be affiliated with the issuer, its affiliates, its officers or directors, the underwriter or any promoter and a valid impoundment agreement is required. (2) For an impoundment agreement to be considered valid, the following terms and conditions must be met: (a) A signed copy of the agreement must be filed with the Securities Commissioner; (b) The agreement must be signed by an officer of the issuer, an officer of the underwriter (if applicable), and an officer of the impoundment agent. The aforesaid individuals must have the authority to sign such documents; (c) The agreement shall provide that the impounded proceeds are not subject to claims by creditors, affiliates, associates, or underwriters of the issuer until the proceeds have been released to the issuer pursuant to the terms of the agreement; (d) A summary of the principal terms of the agreement must be included in the registration statement; and (e) The agreement must provide that the Securities Commissioner has the right to inspect and make or require to be made copies of the records of the impoundment agent at any reasonable time wherever the records are located. (3) The impoundment agent shall notify the Securities Commissioner in writing upon the release of the proceeds. If the proceeds are insufficient to meet the minimum requirements as established by the Securities Commissioner in his sole discretion within the time prescribed by the agreement the impoundment agent must release and return the proceeds directly to the investors with or without interest, depending upon the terms and conditions of the agreement, and without deduction for expenses, including impoundment agent fees. All interest earned shall be distributed pro-rata to the investors, along with the proceeds. (4) If a person, who is an underwriter or an officer, director, promoter, affiliate or associate of the issuer, purchases securities that are a part of the public offering being sold pursuant to the registration statement and if the proceeds from that purchase are used for the purpose of completing the impoundment requirements imposed by this Rule, the following conditions must be met: (a) The persons must be purchasing the securities with investment intent rather than with intent of resale and on the same terms as unaffiliated public investors; (b) The prospectus must contain a disclosure that such persons may purchase securities of the issuer for purposes of completing the impoundment requirements imposed by this Rule; and (c) All securities so purchased will neither be defined as promotional shares, nor be subject to escrow under Section C of this Rule.",

(2) In order for an escrow agreement to be considered valid pursuant to this Rule, a signed copy of the agreement must be filed with and accepted by the Securities Commissioner who, in his discretion, may require additional terms and condition prior to acceptance.",
